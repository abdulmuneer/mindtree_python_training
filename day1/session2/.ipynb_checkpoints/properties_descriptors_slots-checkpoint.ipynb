    "#### Here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `NonNegative` is a descriptor object. \n",
    "* It's a descriptor because it defines the `__get__`, `__set__`, or `__delete__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Movie` class looks *very* clean. We create 4 descriptors at the class level, and treat them like normal (instance-level) attributes everywhere else. And apparently, the desciptors are checking for non-negative values for us.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Accessing a descriptor\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python sees the line ``print m.budget``, it recognizes that budget is a descriptor with a `__get__` method. Instead of passing `m.budget` to print directly, it calls `Movie.budget.__get__`, and feeds the result of *that* to print. This is similar to what happens when you access a property -- Python automatically calls a method, and returns the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "`__get__` receives two arguments: the instance object to the left of the period (that is, the `m` object in `m.budget`), and the type of that instance (`Movie`). In some Python [documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#implementing-descriptors), `Movie` is called the **owner** of the descriptor. If we had asked for `Movie.budget`, Python whould have called `Movie.budget.__get__(None, Movie)`; that is, the fist argument is either an instance of the owner, or ```None```. These input arguments may seem weird to you, but they're there to give you information about what object the descriptor is part of. This will make sense once we look inside the `NonNegative` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assigning to a descriptor\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python sees `m.rating = 100`, Python recognizes `rating` is a descriptor with a ``__set__`` method, and it calls `Movie.rating.__set__(m, 100)`. Like `__get__`, the first argument of `__set__` is the instance to the left of the period (the `m` in `m.rating = 100`). The second argument is the value to the right of the equals sign (100). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deleting a descriptor\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of completeness, if you call `del m.budget`, Python will call `Movie.budget.__delete__(m)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How NonNegative works\n",
    "With this in mind, we can now look to see how the `NonNegative` class works. Each instance of `NonNegative` maintains a dictionary that maps owner instances to data values. When we call `m.budget`, the `__get__` method looks up the data associated with `m`, and returns the result (or a default value, if no such value exists). `__set__` uses the same approach, but includes the extra non-negativity check. We use a `WeakKeyDictionary` instead of a normal `dict` to prevent a memory leak -- we don't want an instance to stay alive simply because it's in the descriptor dictionary, and otherwise unused.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with descriptors is slightly awkward. Because they live at the class level, every instance shares the same descriptor. This means that descriptors have to manually manage different states for different object instances, and need to explicitly be passed instances as the first argument of the `__get__`, ``__set__``, and ``__delete__`` methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, however, this example gives you an idea of what descriptors can be useful for -- they provide a way to organize property logic into isolated classes. If you find yourself repeating the same logic across several properties, that should be a clue to consider whether refactoring that code into a descriptor is worthwhile."
