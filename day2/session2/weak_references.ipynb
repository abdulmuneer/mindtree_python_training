    "The weakref module is a useful tool for creating Python references without impeding object destruction. This section covers the basics of weak references, and introduces a Proxy class enabling weak references to method objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before understanding weak references, first we need to understand whats a strong reference is. Strong references are pointers to objects that have an effect on their reference counts, and hence their lifetime and destruction. Strong references are what you see all the time when you assign an object to a variable:\n",
    "Python\n",
    ">>> a = [1,2,3]\n",
    ">>> b = a\n",

    ">>> b = a\n",

    " \n",

    "In this case, the list object has two strong references to it stored in a and b. The list will not be destroyed until both references are released:\n",

    "Weak references, on the other hand, have no effect on the reference count for an object. The existence of a weak reference never impedes object destruction. That is, if an object has only weak references, it will be destroyed.\n",
